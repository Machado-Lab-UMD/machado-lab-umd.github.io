Iâ€™m Kevin Quinteros, a postdoctoral researcher exploring the intricate relationships between plants and insects. My work combines field research and genomic techniques to uncover the mechanisms driving co-evolution and speciation in these interactions. Currently, I focus on the genomics of fig-wasp mutualisms, investigating how insect chemosensory genes shape host specificity and adaptation. Additionally, I utilize population genomics analyses to understand how genetic variation influences ecological interactions. Through my research, I aim to understand the genetic factors that drive plant-insect coevolution and adaptation.
