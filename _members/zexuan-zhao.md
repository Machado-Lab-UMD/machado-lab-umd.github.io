I am Zexuan Zhao, a PhD candidate specializing in evolutionary genomics and bioinformatics. My research focuses on the genome  evolution of *Pegoscapus* fig wasps, especially on how transposable elements are interwined with genome architecture. Driven by the progression of new sequencing technologies, I am also excited at developing innovative bioinformatic pipelines that help to uncover the unknown realm of genomes.
