#### Our lab uses a diverse suite of approaches to uncover the processes shaping species formation and patterns of genomic diversity. We work on three main key areas/systems.

## Uncovering Genomic Mechanisms Driving Species Divergence in Drosophila

{% capture content %} {% include figure.html image="images/Dpseudoobscura2.jpg" caption="Photo by Alexander Wilde" width="200px" %} {% endcapture %} {% include float.html content=content %} We study the roles of gene flow and natural selection during speciation, and the role of inversions on species divergence. Our work is focused on the divergence between _Drosophila pseudoobscura_ and its close relatives _D. persimilis_ and _D. p. bogotana_. The presence of **chromosomal inversions** in this species group precludes fine scale genetic analyses to characterize the genetic basis of species isolation mechanisms or phenotypic differences between species. In collaboration with Dr. David Stern (HHMI), we have developed genetic tools and reagents specific for this species group that are being used in genome editing experiments aimed at generating/reverting chromosomal inversions. In addition, we are studying the evolution and functional genomics of conserved **long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)** and small ORFs in Drosophila. These understudied genomic elements appear to have important roles in organismal biology and particularly in the divergence of male reproductive processes.

## Investigating Plant-Insect Co-Evolution Through the Fig and Fig Wasp Mutualism
{% capture content %} {% include figure.html image="images/fig wasps.jpg" caption="Fig wasps associated with _Ficus obtusifolia_" width="200px" %} {% endcapture %} {% include float.html content=content %} Both ecologically and evolutionarily, mutualisms represent one of the most influential of all biological interactions, with fundamental consequences for the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. Figs (_Ficus sp._, Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Agaonidae, Chalcidoidea, Hymenoptera) constitute one of the most extraordinary pollination mutualisms known. In addition to the pollinating wasps, a diverse community of non-pollinating wasps also exploits figs. We are using a diverse suite of integrative “omic” and ecological approaches to characterize the geographic context co-diversification of this mutualism, to understand patterns of genome diversity and population genetic diversity in fig wasps, and to uncover genetic and morphological innovation involved in the evolution of synergistic and antagonistic interactions in this mutualism.

## Studying the Genomic Basis of Crop Domestication and Adaptation in Human Parasites
{% capture content %} {% include figure.html image="images/trypanosoma.jpg" caption="Trypanosoma brucei copyright ©Eye of Science / Photo Researchers, Inc." width="200px" %} {% endcapture %} {% include float.html content=content %} Although these topics are not our main research focus, we are happy to host students interested in plant domestication (mostly figs, but we done some work on rice) or human parasite evolution (mostly _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the agent of Chagas’ disease). We have studied the evolutionary history of _T. cruzi_ and other Trypanosomatids using population genetic and genomic data uncovering evidence of hybridization and uncovering a new genetic lineage endemic to North America. Using comparative genomic data, we have shown that inferred genome-wide signals of positive selection are higher in _T. cruzi_ proteins than in Leishmania spp. proteins, a result consistent with the greater versatility of _T. cruzi_ in its host range, cell tropism and cell invasion mechanisms. Currently, we are using genomic data to expand our understanding of _T. cruzi_ diversification, and to the study the dynamics of gene duplication in Trypanosomatid genomes.
