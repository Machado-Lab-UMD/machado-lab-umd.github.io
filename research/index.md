Our lab explores evolutionary genomics to uncover the processes shaping species formation and genomic diversity. Our research focuses on three key areas:

- investigating the genomic mechanisms driving species divergence in Drosophila
- examining the evolution of the mutualism between figs and their pollinating wasps
- using comparative and population genomics to study domestication and adaptation in crops and human parasites.
