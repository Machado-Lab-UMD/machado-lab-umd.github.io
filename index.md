# Welcome to the Machado Lab!

 Our lab explores evolutionary genomics to uncover the processes shaping species formation and genomic diversity. Our research focuses on three key areas: 
  1. investigating the genomic mechanisms driving species divergence in Drosophila, 
  2. examining the evolution of the remarkable mutualism between figs and their pollinating wasps through genomic analysis, and 
  3. using comparative and population genomics to study domestication and adaptation in crops and human parasites.
