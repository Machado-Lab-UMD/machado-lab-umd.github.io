We are excited to share the wonderful news that **Ron Clark has successfully defended his dissertation**!

Ron’s dissertation, titled *“Investigating The Evolution of sORFs and Proto/De Novo Genes in the* Drosophila pseudoobscura *Subgroup using Comparative Transcriptome and Genome Data,”* offers important new insights into genome functionality, focusing on the detection and evolutionary relevance of small ORFs and de novo genes. His work integrates transcriptomic consistency, mass spectrometry, and genomic architecture to explore how these elements evolve and are regulated in *D. pseudoobscura* and *D. persimilis*.

Please join us in congratulating **Dr. Ron Clark** on this major achievement!
